This site is to support the local, Bennion Community Emergency Preparedness Fair coming up on May 18th, 2024. There are many unprecedented events occurring at this time around the world, including AI, War, unrest, and overly intense
(unecessarily intense) political conflict. While I would love to see everyone share an understanding and peacefully collaborate to help one another succeed, there may be some supply chain disruptions, illness, natural disasters, and other
calamities for which we must be pro-active and prepare to help support each other in such times. Our preparations may mean more than present comforts, it may allow the human element of resilience, care, and compassion to shine through
even when the world is surrounded by dark clouds. We're all part of the human race, when faced with adversity, we will win or lose together.
